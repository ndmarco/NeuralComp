Description: Code to gather evidence of Multiplexing (See Groh et al. 'Signal switching may enhance processing power of the brain.' Trends in Cognitive Sciences (2024)), a neural encoding theory that posits that individual neurons can switch between encoding multiple stimuli. The package assumes that data is recorded in 'triplets' of conditions (spike trains from an A stimulus, B stimulus, and A + B stimulus). With these triplets, users can fit our mechanistic statistical model for Multiplexing that posits that the switching occurs due to competition (See Marco, Groh, Tokdar 'Modeling Neural Switching via Drift-Diffusion Models' arXiv preprint 2410.00781 (2024)). Additionally, users are able to fit alternative models, allowing users to gather evidence of multiplexing.
